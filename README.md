Final Project for John Bryce Training course "Python Full Stack Development":

A React based website that is fetching data from a self-made API (Djanfo REST Framework)
to represent the former "Paradise Vacations" website performance and different stats.

The website VacationStats is a dashboard for an Admin (requires authentication),
Statistics about-
* Total number of registered users
* Total number of registered likes
* Pie chart that represents the distribution of previous, ongoing, and future vacations
* Table for likes per country, sorted from most to least

Includes a main home page, about me section, a login page, and the statistics page.
Includes also responsive design, so that the website also can be viewed neatly from a mobile device.
