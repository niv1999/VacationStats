            <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
            <Divider />
            <p>I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a love for creating elegant websites and writing clean code. I completed an intensive full-stack development course using Python at John Bryce in Tel Aviv, which equipped me with the skills to build robust systems from scratch and tackle challenging problems head-on.</p>
            <p>Beyond coding, I'm a geek at heart. Iâ€™ve completed countless escape rooms and love diving into the strategic world of board games. I also enjoy singing and acting in my free time.</p>
            <p>I recently finished two exciting projects: this website, VacationStats, and its partner site, Paradise Vacations. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact links below!</p>
